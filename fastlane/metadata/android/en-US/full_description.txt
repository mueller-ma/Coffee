Coffee allows you to keep the display awake without having to change the device settings. It can be toggled at various places:
* A tile in the quick settings, the place that holds the toggles for e.g. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Requires Android 7 or higher.
* A button in the app itself
* A shortcut on your home screen. It can be created in the app, if your launcher supports it.
