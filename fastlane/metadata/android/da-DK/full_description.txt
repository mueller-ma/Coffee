Coffee allows you to keep the display awake without having to change the device settings. It can be toggled at various places:
* A tile in the quick settings, the place that holds the toggles for e.g. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Requires Android 7 or higher.
* A button in the app itself
* A shortcut on your home screen. It can be created in the app, if your launcher supports it.

Coffee can be set as assist app (Device settings => Apps => Default apps => Assist app) and changes it's state when assist is called.

If you have any issues with Coffee, please consult the help dialog of the app.
Some OEMs implement an overly aggressive battery saver that makes this app unuseable. This issue has been reported on devices of the following OEMs:
* Poco
* Samsung
* Xiaomi
